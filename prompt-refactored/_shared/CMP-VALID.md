# CMP-VALID — Validation Block (v1.0.0)

> Component per `../../prompt-governance/09_REUSABLE_PROMPT_COMPONENTS.md`. Resolves GR-7 quality gates.

**Parameters:** `outputs` = the prompt's declared output artifacts (one check row each).

```

Validation per GR-7. Before completion:
  - GR-7.1  Stop (FAIL) if any REQUIRED input is missing, empty, or schema-invalid.
  - GR-7.2  Emitted JSON parses; every graph edge resolves to an existing node.
  - GR-7.3  Sibling cross-references agree (counts match; cited items exist in their sets).
  - GR-7.4  Every `unknown` / ambiguity becomes an Open Question with a stable ID.
  - GR-7.5  Self-check: no invented facts (GR-1), all claims cited (GR-2/3),
            no excluded paths used (GR-4), no source modified (GR-5).
  - Per declared output {{outputs}}: confirm it exists, is well-formed, and is traceable.
Emit a run verdict: PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL (GOV-04 §5).
  PASS    = all required outputs present, valid, traceable; no unresolved material DISCREPANCY.
  PARTIAL = produced with documented gaps (status: partial + Open Questions).
  FAIL    = missing/invalid required outputs, or unresolved material DISCREPANCY.
